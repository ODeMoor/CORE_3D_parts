# Summary

##### Just like many others i found the cheapo USB orginal microscope stand useless.

 
However I didn't want to go out and buy rods and such, I wanted to make a cheaper design.
I used rack and pinion design to regulate height. 

Now I can control the microscope height smoothly and without wobbling. Tighten the axel nuts and bolts to your liking.

Needed: 
* 3 M3 nuts and bolts about 12-15mm length to tighten the axel so it doesn't slide on its own and to keep the microscope fastend. 
* The holes are 3.4 mm which is about 1/8 inch (in case you have no love for the metric system).

Print: 
* With supports on. 
* 0,15 layer height. 
* See image for recommended print orientation.
* If you find that movement is not soft try to print the pinion with a smaller layer height or otherwise with higher surface quality.
